CO2AX is a decentralized platform that is aimed at addressing the issue of greenhouse gas emissions by major companies in different sectors. The platform operates on the principle of tracking the emissions produced by these companies and taxing them based on a pre-determined threshold. The idea behind this concept is to incentivize companies to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute towards a greener and more sustainable future.
